## Two Machines - One that works, one that probably won't.

### Cookie Machine! (Who doesn't like cookies?)

First things first; Create a Cookie Machine. For this; you'll need the following:
* 1x Cookie
* 2x Redstone Dust
* 1x Button
* 1x Chest

Which will give you the Cookie Machine!~

Next you want to name your creation! So grab an anvil, and rename that sucker!

Good job!

Now, find a nice and open spot (I couldn't be bothered adding any block checks; so make sure there's a free spot 1 block in the X direction for the chest to pop up).

Ah, that looks good! I think it needs some power now. Whack a lever and some redstone dust to it and watch some magic!

Oh wait. It needs something to make the cookies out of. This is a machine; not a magic portal! If only there was some way of knowing what to put in it... Oh wait. There is! "Put Wheat and Sugar in here". Maybe you should do that?

Well done! You did it! Enjoy all your cookez!

### Mining Machine

Cbs making a tutorial on this one. Basically; craft a box using a Chest, Iron Pickaxe, a Button and Two Redstone Dust. Shapeless recipe so doesn't matter where you put it.

Whack the box down, give it some power and fill up the chest with a bit of coal or coal blocks (Coal provides 3 energy, Coal Blocks provide 30.). The minion will start scanning, and begin to run around!

## Theme

The theme for the 2016 Devathon Contest is: **Machines!**
Make a machine, make an interaction with a machine, or do something completely creative! As long as it has something to do with machines, you're good to go.
